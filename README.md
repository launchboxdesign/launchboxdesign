- 👋 Hi, I’m @launchboxdesign
- 👀 I’m interested in transitioning from a graphic design to a frontend web developer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript
- 💞️ In my freetime I like to draw and paint as well as watch some of my favorite shows like: Game of Thrones, Star Wars, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball Super. I also like to listen to one padcast called the Pivot that is vastly becoming one of my favorites.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
